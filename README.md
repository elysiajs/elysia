## Philosophies

Building on top of 3 philosophies:

- Performance
  - You shall not worry about the underlying performance
- Simplicity
  - Simple building blocks to create an abstraction, not repeating yourself
- Flexibility
  - You shall be able to customize most of the library to fit your needs

Designed with TypeScript in mind, you don't need to understand TypeScript to gain the benefit of TypeScript with Elysia. The library understands what you want and automatically infers the type from your code.
